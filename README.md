# RWA.build

**RWA.build** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation that enables AI-assisted development of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization projects on the XRP Ledger.

With RWA.build, you can easily import it into any client like Claude Desktop or Cursor.ai, then chat with the AI to describe your RWA specs and preferred tech stack — whether it’s a web application, mobile app, or a custom setup. The AI will generate the code and integrate it with XRPL just for you.

Think of it as “vibe-based coding” for RWA — fast, flexible, and fully developer-controlled.
